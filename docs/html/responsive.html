<h1>Responsive with CSS em</h1>

<p>
  <code>rem</code> After we establish this known font size, we are safe to use regular ems throughout the module.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=calc"><code>calc()</code> as CSS unit value</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=vw">Viewport units: vw, vh, vmin, vmax</a></li>
</ul>

{% highlight css %}
html {
  font-size: calc(0.6em + 1vw);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  With your page made up of scalable modules, each grounded to the rem value, and they too will scale with the viewport.

{% highlight css %}
.panel--large { font-size: 1.2rem; }

<ul>
  <li><code>1em</code> is the same as the font-size of the current element (more specifically, the width of a capital letter M.) Font sizes are inherited by elements from their parents
  <li>The <code>rem</code> (root em) works in exactly the same way as the em, except that it will always equal the size of the default base font-size</li>
  <li>vw, vh: Respectively these are 1/100th of the width of the viewport, and 1/100th of the height of the viewport, the smaller of the two <code>vmin</code>, or the larger of the two <code>vmax</code></li>
</ul>
